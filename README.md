# Project-6. Weather Dashboard  


Users can input a city name to fetch data from a weather API. Users will be able to see weather details of the current day, and subsequent 5 days. Type the city you wish you view the weather and either press enter or the search button icon.

The city is saved in a search history navbar. The saved list of cities persists in local storage, and remains after refresh

There is a clear history button to clear all local data.

Only valid city names will be accepted. Inputs that are not named cities, or spelled wrong will not be recorded and will not fetch any data. Blank inputs are also not accepted.

I have also prevented duplicate city searches for less clutter
